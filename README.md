# GSMDecoder
Decode GSM 7-bit SMS messages



To install and run:

`- pip install -r requirements.txt`

`- python3 menu.py`


The menu will output:
`Enter filename of binary to decode:`  

Once entered, decoder.py is called and will print any and all sms messages that it decodes to the terminal. (In the future, to separate files for each message)
